### Introduction ###

Knowing of the custom importing framework that this library provides, a user will have at least one script directory to be managed by it.  They'll also have a base namespace in mind which the contents of that script directory are to be contributed to.

The following pages cover the described topics:

> [Importing](Importing.md): How the directory hierarchy maps to namespace entry placement.

> [File changes](FileChanges.md): Automatic code reloading.
